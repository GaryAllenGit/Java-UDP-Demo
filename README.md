A Java Datagram (UDP) Client Server Application.

Written by Gary Allen, University of Huddersfield

Last Update Sept 2017


The files:

UDPServer.java - the server side
UDPClient.java - the client side


To use this demo:

1) Compile all files in your IDE or using:

	javac *.java
	

2) Start the server in your IDE or using:
	java UDPServer


3) Start the client in your IDE or (in another shell tool) using:
	java UDPClient


Note that this demo assumes (for simplicity) that the client and server are running on the same machine.
